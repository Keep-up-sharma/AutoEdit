Information Collection and Use:

To provide you with a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. This information is retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way. Our app may also use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

Cookies are files with small amounts of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory. Our Service does not use these "cookies" explicitly, but our app may use third-party code and libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

We strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your Personal Information, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
